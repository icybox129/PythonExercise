#7) Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class.
# The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100.
# If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge.
# So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.
#Note: The bus seating capacity is 50. so the final fare amount should be 5500.
# You need to override the fare() method of a Vehicle class in Bus class.
